MangaReader
===========

A Visual C# program that supports multiple window support manga/comic viewing. Great for reading comics/manga on multiple screens. Has multiple modes which will be documented soon.

Some Features I Put In
=====================
The program hasthe feature to view manga/comics in multiple windows. One can choose to see the page before or after the picture in the main window. There is a feature to zoom in the picture (Very rough), to read from compressed zip files (You dont have to extract them to read them!!), and to save a session (bookmark the page you were reading).

Status
======

This is a weekend pet project. I have been very slowly working on this project from time to time. I shall add documentation when I have the chance.
